            <p>The sound of war is loud at night in Beirut’s eastern Achrafieh neighbourhood.
                Residents can hear Israeli air strikes hitting the Lebanese capital’s southern suburbs, known as
                Dahieh. Some can even see the explosions lighting up the sky from their balconies.
                However, on the streets it is quiet. Volunteers in uniform are patrolling the predominantly
                Christian neighbourhood holding walkie-talkies to co-ordinate their operation.
                The neighbourhood watch was formed a few years ago following the financial crisis that hit
                Lebanon to reassure residents worried about crime. But with recent developments, the mission has
                changed.
                "We have concerns with displaced people who are coming in huge numbers to Beirut, and they have
                a lot of needs, and it is very complicated,” says Nadim Gemayel, who formed the organisation
                behind the neighbourhood watch.
                Communities across Lebanon rallied to help house and feed the hundreds of thousands of families
                who were displaced when Israel escalated its air campaign against Hezbollah last month before
                launching a ground invasion of the south.
                However, an influx of people from the predominantly Shia Muslim areas where the Iran-backed
                group has a strong presence - Dahieh, south Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley in the east - into
                places which are majority Sunni Muslim and Christian also risk exacerbating sectarian divisions
                in a country where memories of the 1975-1990 civil war are still vivid.
                Recent Israeli attacks on those areas has only served to heighten tensions between residents and
                the displaced.
                A strike on 14 October in the northern town of Aitou, which killed 23 displaced people, shook
                the Christian community.

                Many here believe that Israel won’t stop until Hezbollah is completely disarmed.
                "Either all Lebanon will be destroyed by Israel which will be catastrophic, or they [Hezbollah]
                surrender and give up their arms, and we build a Lebanese state that will be based on the Taif
                agreement, and everyone has equal rights and obligations," says Nadim Gemayel.
